Countdown for the premiere of the new season of the tv show Grey's Anatomy. This project was done with Javascript to train my new skills about the Date object.

[X] Javascript <br>
    * DOM manipulation (querySelector and innerHTML);<br>
    * Date object;<br>
    * Function;<br>
    * Timers (setInterval);<br>
    * Template String;<br>
    * Ternary operator condition.<br>
[X] CSS<br>
[X] HTML

Warning: This characters as well the tv show mentioned in this project is property of the ABC America Television. I do not own any of it. This was used to education purposes only (and just because I like the show. I hope you guys enjoy).
