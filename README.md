# Greys_Anatomy_Season_19_CountDown

Countdown for the premiere of the new season of the tv show Grey's Anatomy. This project was done with Javascript to train my new skills about the Date object.

This projet was done using:

[X] Javascript
    * DOM manipulation (querySelector and innerHTML);
    * Date object;
    * Function;
    * Timers (setInterval);
    * Template String;
    * Ternary operator condition.
[X] CSS
[X] HTMl

Warning: This characters as well the tv show mentioned in this project is property of the ABC America Television. I do not own any of it. This was used to education purposes only (and just because I like the show. I hope you guys enjoy).
